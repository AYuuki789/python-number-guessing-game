# Number Guessing Game (Python)

This is a beginner Python console project where the player guesses a random number between 1 and 9.

## Features

* Random number generation
* Input validation (handles letters and invalid input)
* Limited tries system
* "Too high / Too low" hints
* Play again option (y/n)
* Error handling using try/except

## What I Learned

* While loops (nested loops)
* Try and Except for invalid input
* Debugging logic errors (tries reset bug)
* Structuring a simple game loop

This project was built as part of my Python learning journey.
